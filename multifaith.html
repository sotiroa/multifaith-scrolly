The event, titled “Community Roundtable: A Palestinian-Jewish Dialogue,” featured a panel of two Palestinian-Americans and two Israeli-Americans sharing personal reflections, followed by small group discussions.</p><p class="s3" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">dfdddfdfdfdfdf</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">The event was co-sponsored by the Peninsula Multifaith Coalition (PMC), a volunteer-led organization made up of various faith congregations, and the Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue Group, a longstanding nonviolent conflict resolution initiative.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Building a Space for Conversation</h2><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">John Poole, one of the event’s organizers, was already a member of PMC when he learned about the Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue Group. He became immediately interested in it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“This was after October 7th, and I was feeling really adrift,” he said. “I just felt really thrown off-center by the whole thing.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">Through the dialogue group, Jews, Palestinians, and others meet monthly in each others’ living rooms to exchange personal stories and envision a shared future. In 1992, the group held its first meeting in a San Mateo living room, and at its peak, expanded to seven groups meeting in living rooms across the Bay Area.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“They didn’t disband,” Poole said. “They just kind of became friendship groups and stopped meeting formally. The result was that only this one continued as a formal, ongoing meeting.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">Poole and Miriam Zimmerman, another member of both groups, saw potential to reignite the dialogue group’s momentum by hosting an event co-sponsored by PMC. Initially, they approached their rabbi, Rabbi Nathaniel Ezray. While Ezray offered to host it at Congregation Beth Jacob, concerns about rising antisemitism led the synagogue’s security to decline.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“They were concerned that it wouldn&#39;t be safe to hold the event there,” Poole said. “And so, right away, the pastor here, Pastor Jim, said, ‘We’ll do it here.’”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">Pastor Jim Mitulski of Congregational Church of the Peninsula shared his hopes for the event in the congregation’s newsletter, writing, “The United States has sent weapons and now soldiers to aid Israel. Whatever your politics, I hope you will join us to listen and learn, and let us be ceaseless in prayer for peace. Our hospitality in hosting this and other events that promote relationship and reconciliation, while not without risk, is our way of saying we need to talk with each other.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="242" height="134" alt="image" src="multifaith_files/Image_002.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Listening to Panelist Perspectives</h2><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One of the first panelists, Israeli-American Adee Horn, reflected on the experiences that brought her to dialogue work.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“My parents met in Beersheba in the 1950s, and it was love at first sight,” she said, recounting her family’s move from the newly established Israel to the United States so her father could pursue a master’s degree in engineering. Settling in Chicago, her family maintained strong ties to Israel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“Having an Israeli mother meant I always had this connection to Israel. It shaped who I was—through the food, the culture, the art—but it was different from how my Jewish-American peers grew up.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">She described the lingering shadow of trauma from the Holocaust in her household. “There was never a time I didn’t know about the Holocaust,” she said. “Images of emaciated bodies, barbed wire, and train whistles—those memories are visceral for me.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">She recalled an incident when, as a sixth grader, she told her mother she had been asked to “go steady” by a boy from an Irish family. Her mother’s response was clear: “Well, I guess you’ll finish Hitler’s job.” The comment, born of trauma, left a lasting impression.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">Her perspective shifted during the Second Intifada when she worked as a teacher at Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco, which had a significant Palestinian and Jewish student population. When a conflict had risen between students, Horn was part of a mediation session. She recounted a moment with a Palestinian student, Jelena, whom she had known since middle school:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">“I told her, ‘I’m Jewish and Israeli-American. Does that make you hate me?’ She said, ‘Of course I don’t hate you, Adee. I love you.’ She threw her arms around me and gave me this big hug. It was this transformative moment in my life.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">She said that when she had asked the student that question, she hadn’t understood there was “a little kid” within her asking it as well.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">“It was like the blinders blew off in that moment,” she said. “I realized that I really needed to explore this part of me, and learn what I hadn’t been willing—been too afraid—to learn and unlearn.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">She described her early encounters with Palestinian-owned stores in San Francisco: “Hearing Arabic or an Arabic accent would trigger a cold fear in me. I’d wonder, ‘If they knew I was Jewish or Israeli-American, would they kick me out?’” By becoming part of a dialogue group and forming relationships with Palestinians, she confronted these assumptions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“I always was raised that there was nobody in Palestine,” she said. “I didn&#39;t know there were people there for many generations, thousands of years. I was holding, then, this complexity: I wouldn&#39;t be here in front of you all if my grandfather wasn&#39;t able to get his Visa to Palestine. That&#39;s why my family survived. And at the same time, my family&#39;s existence and survival is in a country where [it] meant the expulsion and the killing of Palestinian people. To hold that both is then the journey.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">She concluded with reflections on her ongoing work as a teacher, particularly in her role in supporting Palestinian students. Last year, one of her Palestinian students asked her to sponsor the Middle Eastern North African club. And after October 7, she saw one of her students, a Palestinian senior, walking toward her in the hallway.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">“Once again, I realized I had this unconscious voice saying, ‘Wow, are the kids going to even want to talk to me?’” she said. “And before I could even ask him how he was and his family [were], he asked me, how was I? How was my family?”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">Panelist Melek Totah shared next, beginning her reflection with her experiences growing up Palestinian in Des Moines, Iowa.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">“When I was younger, I wasn’t really told a lot about my family background,” she said. “It wasn’t really mentioned. As I got older and went to college, I learned more. But what I did know is that my dad was different than all the other dads.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">Totah described her father, who spoke with a heavy accent, had a distinctive physical presence, and rarely discussed his origins. “People would ask him, ‘So, where are you from, Mr. Nash?’ And he would say, ‘I’m American.’ He would never share that he was from Haifa.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">Her father, born in 1921, fled Haifa with his family during the events of 1948. The trauma of displacement left an indelible mark on him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“There was a lot of fighting happening,” Totah said. “There was a point, I think, where there were wheelbarrows being wheeled down King George Street with dynamite. That was kind of the last straw. So my family decided that we would leave. My aunt Marta decided to stay in the house, but later, Israeli forces came and told her she needed to leave. She was very old and fragile, so somehow she made her way to a nunnery—or she passed away.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">Reflecting on her father’s experience, Totah noted how it shaped his outlook, prompting him to change the family name from Nasser to Nash.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">“It scarred my dad for his whole life. He really didn’t want to talk about it. He didn’t want us to know. He definitely didn’t want to teach us Arabic, and he definitely didn’t want anyone to know he was Palestinian.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Growing up, Totah gradually came to understand the cultural nuances her father carried into their home.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“He would always put yogurt on rice. We’d go to other people’s houses and say, ‘Can we have some yogurt with our rice?’ and they’d all look at us,” she said, laughing. “And when our friends came over, instead of going back to his room, my dad would say, ‘Come, sit down.’ He’d bring food, talk to them, and get to know them. That was really different from other parents.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As she grew older, Totah began to reconcile her father’s past with her own experiences.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“One darker side was that my dad was very anti-Semitic,” she said. “He really never had a kind word to say about a Jewish person, and I grew up with that. It’s sad because I think a lot of us get handed this generational hate. Being the curious person I was, I was a little worried but excited to meet Jewish people when I went to college. And I’ll be honest, the Jewish folks I met were warm, had an amazing sense of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="306" height="228" alt="image" src="multifaith_files/Image_003.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">humor, and their culture was kind of similar to mine.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">Through these relationships and her involvement in a Jewish-Palestinian dialogue group, Totah found healing and understanding.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“At first, I thought, ‘Oh gosh, no, that doesn’t sound interesting at all to me,’” she said about the prospect of joining a dialogue group. “But I’ve been in it now for maybe 25, 30 years. It’s been an amazing experience. It helped me with some of that trauma I was handed.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">Totah closed by reflecting on the lessons she’s learned from dialogue work.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">“An enemy is someone’s story you haven’t heard,” she said. “I truly believe that. A lot of our struggles are because we don’t talk to each other.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">Israeli-American panelist Adee Horn (left) chats with an attendee after the panelist portion of the event.

Printed prompts such as “What in the stories touched you or had meaning for you?” and “What is on your heart right now?” were on each roundtable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“We could have gone on for another hour,” Bob Goldberg, a first-time participant in a dialogue group, said after the event. “We got to the point where the two Palestinian women reached out and we held hands.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">At his table, Goldberg listened as one of the Palestinian women expressed concern about revealing her last name, explaining that she felt like a minority within the space.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“I mentioned that, well, actually, we’re both minorities in the Bay Area, and in the country,” Goldberg said. “I told her about how some of the people that I knew had to change their names… My uncle couldn’t get a job as an engineer—we&#39;re talking about in the ‘40s—because his last name was Goldberg.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“It was nice to know that we had connected,” he continued. “In a way, the discussion was both uplifting, and also made me feel sad. The uplifting part was where the people were saying that their fathers were virulently hating, but then once they got to have a dialogue, they were able to let go of that. The description of Israel not fulfilling the ideal that I was raised with… to hear it described as, that they really lost that ideal—I still, in my head, haven’t quite heard that or understood that.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">In reflecting on the dialogue group’s approach, Poole spoke about a discussion from a recent meeting when a longtime member said, in Poole’s words, “This is all very good, but, you know, it just sounds like a psychotherapy group to me, a bunch of people sitting around and trying to feel better. What effect does it really have unless you do something outward?”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For Poole, the Nov. 3 event is something outward.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“It’s actually the dialogue group making itself present in the community so other people can see it and go, ‘Oh, this is a different way of doing things,’” he said.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">Poole views dialogue groups as alternatives to forms of traditional activism, like protests. While protests have value, he said, they tend to frame issues as a set of opposing narratives.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“In our group, what we’ve discovered is that the ones who grew up as Palestinian kids, they were told a certain narrative about Israel,” he said. “The Jewish kids grew up with exactly the same kind of narrative, but the roles reversed: who was the bad guy, who was the good guy, what was unjust, what was scary. Discussing it from actual personal experiences—not just history books, but from personal experiences—[we realized] both had some part of the truth, but were completely ignorant of a lot of the truth, also.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">Poole hopes to help form new dialogue groups beyond San Mateo that can “create a third, shared narrative.” For him, the group has been grounding after struggling to balance feeling a connection to Israel, yet also shame.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mpsum</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="368" height="246" alt="image" src="multifaith_files/Image_004.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">A banner reading “LOVE AND LIFE DEMAND PERMANENT CEASEFIRE NOW” stands outside the Congregational Church of the Peninsula in Belmont, Calif. on Nov. 3, 2024.
